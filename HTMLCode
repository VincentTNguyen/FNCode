                        <h1>Let’s Face It: Whether We Choose to Admit It or Not, EVERY Family Has Problems.</h1>
                        <p>At one time or another, virtually every family from over 120M households in the U.S. encounters some sort of issue that morphs into a serious problem…and most families typically encounter more than one or two serious problems over the span of time as a family.</p>
                        <p>In far too many cases, lives are cut short due to the destructive nature of many of those problems. It’s devastating when families lose loved ones, especially when tragic outcomes could have been avoided.</p>
                        <p>The ability of families to avert tragedy becomes impaired out of a sense of helplessness or isolation because in most cases, they don’t know where to turn for immediate and responsive help.</p>

                    <h1>This Is A Big Problem Because Until Now, There’s Been No Destination or Space That’s Specifically Designed And Dedicated Especially For Families</h1>
                    <p>Unless you have experience in dealing with a particular problem, or know of a professional or another family that does, it’s a struggle to find timely access to accurate information from a relevant and reliable source. <strong>Precious and valuable time is lost while searching for the proper resource or solution!</strong></p>
                    <p>As a result, families must “hop-scotch” around the internet or spend valuable time making phone calls or rummage through email to find help. This causes delays. <strong>Delays cause loss of valuable time. Loss of valuable time may result in unintended but serious consequences, if not loss of life.</strong></p>

                        <p>Traditional social networks are a non-event when it comes to helping resolve family problems -- they weren’t designed for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>They are not designed to bring families together as a community to help one another and they aren’t places where professionals tend to gather to leverage their experience and know-how to help families overcome serious problems.</p>
                        <p>They offer inadequate privacy and intrusion protection and there’s too much irrelevant “noise” or chatter in a cocktail lounge atmosphere, making them ineffective as viable alternatives for families to turn to for help.</p>

                    <p>We provide timely access to relevant information and content that is managed and curated by experts and professionals in a network that maintains privacy and protection from unwanted intrusion or disruption.</p>
                    <p>This is our purpose and our Mission…it is why we exist. It’s very disturbing to us that there are no online or mobile solutions that are designed or available specifically for families to rely on when they need immediate help. This frustration motivated us to act so we are introducing the first of its kind in the form of a secure, community-based network composed of professionals, partners and families that, together, help put an end to the difficulties and suffering that millions of families experience when they encounter serious traumas and problems.</p>

                <div class="col2">
                    <p>Community-oriented relationships foster gatherings of families interacting and collaborating with one another towards a common goal. When families find solutions to their problems or challenges and then share the outcomes of those experiences with their community, the entire community benefits thanks to the timely action, reliance, resourcefulness and sense of urgency that thrives in that community in the name of helping other families who may be in distress. FamilyNation enables families to join our online and mobile communities to form relationships and align with professionals, partners and other families to share ideas, exchange information, discuss experiences and learn about resources that help to manage or resolve serious problems but in a secure and trusted network that protects members rights to privacy and prevents unwanted disruption or intrusion.</p>

                </header>
                <p>Thank you for visiting our website. As a startup, we are in the process of developing a "minimally viable product" (MVP), which will focus solely on the subject of bullying. While FamilyNation seeks to provide access for solutions to a broad range of problems, we’ve chosen <strong>bullying</strong> as our entry point due to its seriousness and destructive impact across virtually every community throughout the U.S.</p>
                <p>With the MVP, we intend to demonstrate our capacities in managing specific unit economics, (i.e., <strong>activation, acquisition, conversion, retention, referral, etc.</strong>), that play substantial roles in the suitability, relevance and sustainability of our business model. Our comprehension of these metrics that require constant nurturing and optimization is essential in order for us to provide better user experiences with more meaningful content, resources, and benefits. These components support the foundations for market fit and product fit that we must manage and maintain in order to scale the business. Successful management of our unit economics will better prepare us to support what families require of us as we work to help them so we take this part of our business especially seriously.</p>
                <p>We trust that we have communicated our story effectively and in a meaningful way so that you identify with the importance and urgency of what we’re doing and why we're doing it. We encourage you to stay tuned by following us here and on <a href="#">Twitter (@1FamilyNation)</a>, in anticipation of our “MVP” release. <strong>We welcome and embrace any feedback, questions or ideas you may have</strong> – they will help us become a better company. That’s kind of important to us, too, so we take your input very seriously, as we should.</p>

                    <h1>Let's Stop The Madness</h1>
                    <p>In summary, families, whether single or nuclear, are affected by many destructive and undermining problems and, in many cases, people are needlessly dying.</p>
                    <p>FamilyNation seeks to end this madness with the introduction of a dedicated and specific destination for families to turn to for help. We invite and encourage you and your family to join us, whether it’s due to a serious problem that is confronting your family or to lend a helping hand to another family who may be facing a similar situation that you may have previously experienced.</p>
                    <p>Together, communities of families, working beside professionals and partners, can change the way families confront serious issues and how they view their place in <strong>a world that’s free from serious traumas and problem</strong>s that have debilitating effects on them.</p>
                    <p>As we often say, <strong>“When there’s an opportunity to help others, how can we not?”</strong></p>
